It really is that simple. In just a few short clicks, would-be network participants will earn considerable passive income for up to a year. For community members who have previously set up an infinity node, SINOVATE setUP provides the perfect opportunity to reassess your VPS needs at a fraction of the cost.

In-wallet one-click infinity node cold hosting will be available as soon as the network upgrade initiates.
