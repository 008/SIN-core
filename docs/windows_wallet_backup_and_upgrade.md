## Windows QT Wallet Backup and Upgrade Guide

  

* First of all, don't forget to back up your current data.

* Close your wallet.

* Open the Run window using the WIN + R key combination.


* Enter the `%appdata%/SIN` command and click the OK button. Thus, you will reach the directory where your SIN data is kept.

Your wallet.dat file can be either in the wallets directory or in the SIN home directory, depending on the situation. Pay attention to this and back up these files to a suitable medium. We recommend that you do this periodically.
