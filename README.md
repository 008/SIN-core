SUQA 0.17.1 rebase over Bitcoin
===============================


Bitcoin 0.17.1 (commit e118565) forked to bring SUQA inline with the most recent codebase.

All existing functionality including timechecklockverify/termdeposits working and tested; as well as a few bugs corrected. All work has been sectioned into squashed commits for easy reference.

The majority of the work here is logic/consensus based; not GUI/rebrand type work, however the client is fully compatible and quick. Some items of menial importance have been left in place to preserve consensus with original SUQA client (FORKENING blockheights etc).
