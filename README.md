**SINOVATE (SIN)** is a new Peer-to-Peer (P2P) digital currency and  ecosystem which creates unique and modern Blockchain products, services and solutions.

**SIN** embraces this new technology and has executed extensive research,  on various ways to educate others and help them implement innovation into their daily lives and businesses.

**SINOVATE** believes in transparency and are open about the current challenges the crypto community faces. To overcome these, an experienced and talented team which works alongside the community has been assembled, paving the way towards mass adoption of cryptocurrency.

SINOVATE (SIN) combines its brand new **X25X Proof of Work (PoW)** algorithm with Komodoâ€™s unique security mechanism, known as Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW).

X25X is CPU as well as GPU mineable and ensures **ASIC, FPGA and QUANTUM resistance**,  solidifying the decentralised consensus mechanism in the process.
